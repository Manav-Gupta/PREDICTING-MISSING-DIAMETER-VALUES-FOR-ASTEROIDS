# PREDICTING MISSING DIAMETER VALUES FOR ASTEROIDS
Predicting the missing values for the diameter of an asteroid using deep learning technique LSTM( Long Short Term Memory) 

The dataset has been gathered from Jet Propulsion Laboratory of California Institute of Technology which is a part of the NASA.

The idea for the application of deep learning to the dataset stemmed from a post on Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/basu369victor/prediction-of-asteroid-diameter) highlighting the absence of diameter in the official data collected by NASA. The author applied a variety of machine learning techniques but could not employ deep learning into his research. This post does exactly that by using multivariate LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) to predict the missing values in the data based on the other factors like albedo and H(Absolute Magnitude Parameter).
